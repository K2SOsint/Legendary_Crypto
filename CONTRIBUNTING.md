## üìå Guidelines

1. **Relevance**  
   - Only submit tools, resources, or platforms that are directly useful for crypto transaction research, OSINT, forensics, compliance, or AML.  
   - Do not submit investment services, trading bots, gambling, or unrelated content.  

2. **Legitimacy**  
   - Resources should be legal, ethical, and publicly accessible.  
   - Darknet markets or explicitly illicit services will not be accepted.  
   - Mixers/tumblers may be added only when clearly labeled as *OSINT targets*, not endorsements.  

3. **Quality**  
   - Prefer official project links, GitHub repos, or reputable publications.  
   - Avoid broken links, duplicates, or outdated sources.  
   - If suggesting a new section, explain why it adds value.  

4. **Format**  
   - Use existing Markdown style:  
     ```markdown
     - [Tool Name](https://example.com/) ¬∑ short description
     ```  
   - Group additions under the correct section (e.g., Blockchain Explorers, APIs, Learning Resources).  
   - Keep descriptions concise and neutral.
